## <a name="quick-start">ü§∏ Quick Start</a>

Follow these steps to set up the project locally on your machine.

**Prerequisites**

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

-   [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
-   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager)

**Cloning the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stevenGarciaDev/simple-meditation-app-expo-react-native.git
cd simple-meditation-app-expo-react-native
```

**Updating Dependencies**
To ensure your project is using the latest stable versions of Expo and React Native:

Run the Expo upgrade command:

```bash
expo upgrade
```

This will update package.json and install the correct versions of dependencies.

**Installation**

If you did not run, _expo upgrade_, then install the project dependencies manually using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

**Fixing Vulnerabilities**

If you see security vulnerabilities or warnings after running `npm install`, follow these steps:

1. **Check for vulnerabilities**

    ```bash
    npm audit
    ```

2. **Fix vulnerabilities**

    ```bash
    npm audit fix
    ```

**Running the Project**

The --clear flag clears the cache.

```bash
npx expo start --clear
```

**Expo Go**

Download the [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go) app onto your device, then use it to scan the QR code from Terminal and run.

**iOS Simulator**

Navigate to the [Expo documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/) to learn how to install and run your application on an iOS Simulator for local development.

**Android Emulator**

Navigate to the [Expo documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/) to learn how to install and run your application on an Android Emulator for local development.
